# Quantum Classification

`classical_quantum_classification.ipynb`: We see the trainability of quantum machine learning classification compared with classical one.

`quantum_classification.ipynb`: We check the effect of the circuit structures and cost functions on the trainability of QML using OR dataset.

`quantum_classification_iris.ipynb`: We also see the trainability for a more practical dataset, or iris dataset.

# Quantum Classification

We see the trainability of quantum machine learning classification compared with classical one in `classical_quantum_classification.ipynb`, and we check the effect of the circuit structures and cost functions on the trainability of QML in `quantum_classification.ipynb` using OR dataset. We also see the traingability for a more practical dataset, or iris dataset in `quantum_classification_iris.ipynb`.

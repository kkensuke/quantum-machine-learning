# Quantum Classification

We see the trainability of quantum machine learning classification compared with classical one (`classical_quantum_classification.ipynb`), and we check the effect of the circuit structures and cost functions on the trainability of QML (`quantum_classification.ipynb`) using OR dataset. We also see the traingability for a more practical dataset, or iris dataset (`quantum_classification_iris.ipynb`).

# Quantum Machine Learning

## Quantum Classification

We see the trainability of quantum machine learning classification compared with classical one in `classical_quantum_classification.ipynb`.

We check the effect of the circuit structures and cost functions on the trainability of QML using OR dataset in `quantum_classification.ipynb`.

We also see the trainability for a more practical dataset, or iris dataset in `quantum_classification_iris.ipynb`.
